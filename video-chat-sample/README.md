# Video + Chat sample using Window Manager

This sample demonstrates how dual-screen/foldable devices can be well suited for streaming apps. Often streaming experiences will have both a video panel and a live discussion panel. This app uses the information from Jetpack Window Manager to decide the best layout of these two panels. MotionLayout helps animate the transition between different layouts,  as the application is rotated around, typed in, or spanned across a fold.
