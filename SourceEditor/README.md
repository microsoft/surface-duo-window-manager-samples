# SourceEditor

This sample contains a Kotlin application designed for Surface Duo. The application is an HTML editor that enables real-time rendering of formatted source code. Making use of the [dual view](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#dual-view) app pattern, users are able to edit and preview any changes simultaneously without switching windows.

## Getting Started

To learn how to load apps on the Surface Duo emulator, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/android), and follow [the blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/surface-duo).

## Features

This project uses [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments), one to display a code editing window and another to render and display formatted code through a [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView). The app starts in single screen mode, but can be spanned to enable dual screen mode. See the Getting Started section above for more information about spanning.

### Mirrored Scrolling

If more content exists than can be displayed on the screen at once, users can scroll to view hidden content. In dual screen mode, scrolling of one screen (either editor or preview) will be mirrored on the other screen to ensure the user is always looking at relevant content.

### File Saving

To save any changes made in the editor, the save icon in the top toolbar can be pressed. The user will then be brought to a prompt where they can enter a title and location.

### File Selection

To choose a new file to open, the folder icon in the top toolbar can be pressed. A prompt will then open where the user can choose which file they want to select.

### Drag and Drop

This project also supports drag and drop functionality. If a file gallery is open in one screen, text files can be dragged into the Source Editor application. Dropping a file onto the editor or preview screen will import the file's text into the application.

## Single Screen Mode

In single screen mode, users are able to view one of two screens at a time: editor or preview. A button appears in the editor window that allows users to view a preview of the source code. In order to go back to the editor from the preview screen, perform Android's "back" gesture or by pressing the back button on your device. In single screen mode, users can reference other sites such as developer forums while using the app.

## Dual Screen Mode

In dual screen mode, both windows are visible, so no buttons are visible to enable transitions. In this layout, users can scroll on the code side, subsequently scrolling the preview screen, and vice versa. Changes to text in the editor will update the preview in real time using a [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel).

## Orientation

This project supports various rotation configurations. In order to enable orientation changes within the application, ensure that rotation is enabled within the Duo emulator/device itself. This can be done by swiping down from the top of the screen and selecting the rotation icon. Examples of different orientation layouts are available in the screenshots folder.
