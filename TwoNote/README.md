# TwoNote

This sample integrates various dual-screen app features into a note-taking app for the Surface Duo. Users can view and edit notes via the [list-detail](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#master-detail) or [extended canvas](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#extended-canvas) dual-screen app patterns. Each note may contain text and images, which can both be imported through drag/drop. In addition, users can add drawings and annotations to their notes with pen events.

## Getting Started

To learn how to load apps on the Surface Duo emulator, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/android), and follow [the blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/surface-duo).

## Features

In contrast to the original TwoNote [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/surface-duo-app-samples/tree/main/TwoNote) which utilizes Microsoft's [SurfaceDuoLayout](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/android/api-reference/dualscreen-library/layouts/surfaceduo-layout) to handle dual screen devices, this project makes use of Jetpack [Window Manager](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window) API. This sample uses Window Manager to handle events that require consideration of a hinge or fold in the device's screen.

In addition to including various dual-screen enhancements, this app supports a range of operations related to notes, note categories, and note contents.

### Notes

Notes can be created by clicking the floating action button in the list view. To rename a note, click on its current title and make the desired changes. To delete a note, users can choose `Delete` from the overflow menu in the detail view of the note. To delete multiple notes at once, long-click on notes or choose `Select all` from the overflow menu in the list view. To share a screenshot of an individual note, choose the `Share` option in the note detail view.

### Categories

Notes can also be sorted into different categories, which are accessible via the dropdown in the list view. To add or delete a category, choose the appropriate option from the overflow menu. Like with notes, to rename a category, click on its current title and make the desired changes. To switch categories, open the dropdown and select a different category.

### Note Editing Modes

#### Text Mode - Drag and Drop

To add text to the note, click on the `Tap here to add note contents` hint and start typing. Users can also import existing text files to the note via drag/drop. For more information on creating drop targets for various drag events, reference this [drag and drop sample](https://github.com/microsoft/surface-duo-sdk-samples-kotlin/tree/master/DragAndDrop).

#### Image Mode - Drag and Drop

Images can be added to the note via drag and drop. Once imported, the images can be resized using zoom gestures on a particular image. Users can also move an image to a different position on the note by long clicking the image and dragging it. To delete an image, click the delete button and then click on any image that needs to be removed.

#### Ink Mode - Pen Events

This sample provides pen event support to allow for a smooth and pressure-sensitive inking experience. Users can use the buttons at the bottom of the screen to choose from a variety of colors and stroke thicknesses to write, draw, highlight, and erase within a note, as well as undo previous strokes and clear the entire canvas. To learn more about the capabilities of touch events and pens, visit this [pen event blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/surface-duo/pen-events-on-the-surface-duo/).

### Extended Canvas

When spanned in dual-landscape mode, the app switches to the [extended canvas](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#extended-canvas) app pattern. This gives the user more screen real estate when editing note contents, which is especially useful for annotating pictures and creating drawings (see screenshot above).

### List-Detail

When spanned in dual-portrait mode, the app takes advantage of the [list-detail](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#master-detail) app pattern to simultaneously display a list of existing notes and a more detailed view of a selected note.
